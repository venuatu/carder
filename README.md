# Carder

A simple android app (using Scala and Macroid) to show my contact details and push them over NFC into someone elses contacts app.

## Building

~~~~~sh

# get a copy of SBT
# get the android sdk and set ANDROID_HOME=$THE_DIRECTORY
# connect an android device/emulator
sbt android:run

# this works great with SBTs tilde (~) operator to watch for code changes and push a new build
